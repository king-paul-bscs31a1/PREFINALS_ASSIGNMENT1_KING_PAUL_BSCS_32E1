# Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
## Conceptual Understanding:
 
### Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
#### Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
 - Yes, I'm familiar with the Onion Architecture principle, which emphasizes a layered architectural style for software design, promoting separation of concerns and testability.
 
### MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
#### Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 - Yes, I'm well-versed in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern commonly used in web application development, where the Model represents the data, the View represents the presentation layer, and the Controller handles the logic and acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
 
### Web API: (Yes/No) 
#### Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
  - Yes, I understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API, which involves creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles for exchanging data over HTTP.





## Application & Bottlenecks:
### Onion Architecture:
### Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 - In .NET Core projects, Onion Architecture offers several notable advantages. Firstly, its modular structure promotes code organization into distinct layers, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability as the project grows. Secondly, the architecture's emphasis on separation of concerns enhances testability, enabling developers to write focused and comprehensive unit tests for each layer. Thirdly, its flexibility allows for independent updates and modifications within each layer, reducing the risk of unintended side effects across the application. Lastly, Onion Architecture encourages a clean and structured codebase, leading to improved overall code quality and developer productivity.
 
### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 
### MVC:
### Components: (1-3 keywords each)
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 - In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the Model represents the application's data and business logic, handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The View is responsible for presenting the user interface elements to the users, displaying data from the Model and capturing user input. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, processing user requests, updating the Model based on user input, and selecting the appropriate View to render the response.
 
### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 

### Web API:
### Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 - Traditional MVC applications are primarily focused on rendering HTML views to be displayed in web browsers, providing interactive user interfaces for web applications. On the other hand, Web APIs are designed for data exchange over HTTP, typically returning structured data (such as JSON or XML) to be consumed by client applications. Unlike MVC, Web APIs do not focus on rendering views but rather on exposing endpoints to allow clients to interact with the server and perform operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources.
 
### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
